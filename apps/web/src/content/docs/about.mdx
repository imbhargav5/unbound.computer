## What is Unbound?

Unbound is a development tool that pairs a background Rust daemon with native client applications to provide AI-assisted coding sessions. The daemon manages Claude CLI processes, tracks sessions in a local SQLite database, handles authentication, and orchestrates git operations -- all through a Unix socket IPC interface that any client can connect to.

The system follows a local-first architecture: all session data lives in SQLite on your machine, and the daemon operates fully offline. When signed in, sessions optionally sync to Supabase with end-to-end encryption (X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305), enabling cross-device access through the web app.

Real-time streaming uses a dual-path sync model: **Ably** serves as the hot path for instant message delivery (via the Falco sidecar through `daemon-ably`), while **Supabase** serves as the cold path for durable, batched message sync (via the Levi worker). Presence/availability heartbeats are published to a **Cloudflare Durable Object** stream for command gating. Inbound remote commands (e.g., web-initiated sessions) flow through Ably into the Nagato sidecar (also through `daemon-ably`), which forwards them to the daemon for processing.

## Tech Stack

**Daemon (Rust)**
- Tokio async runtime
- SQLite via rusqlite (WAL mode, async executor)
- libgit2 via git2 crate
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 + X25519 encryption
- Unix domain sockets via interprocess
- clap for CLI, tracing for logging
- PostHog + Sentry sinks via shared observability crate

**Daemon Sidecars (Go)**
- Ably SDK for real-time pub/sub (via `daemon-ably`)
- Binary frame protocol over Unix domain sockets
- Stateless, crash-safe design

**macOS App (Swift)**
- SwiftUI with MVVM architecture
- Unix socket IPC to daemon
- swift-log for structured logging
- Keychain integration for secure storage

**Web App (TypeScript)**
- Next.js (App Router)
- Supabase client for auth and data
- Sentry for error tracking
- Biome for linting/formatting

**Infrastructure**
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime)
- Ably (real-time message delivery, remote command routing)
- Cloudflare Durable Objects (presence/availability stream)
- pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- AGPL-3.0 license
