# Why use cache()?

```
import { cache } from 'react'
```

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#deduplicate-requests-and-cache-data


TLDR: cache(async supabasequery) helps to make sure that resource is only
fetched once per request. So if you two componetns in a tree are requesting the same data then it is only fetched once.
